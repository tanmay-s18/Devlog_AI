# 🧠 DEVLOG AI

### A Personal Coding Journal with AI-Powered Refinement

---

## ✨ What is DEVLOG AI?

DEVLOG AI is a full-stack web application that helps developers transform messy daily coding notes into structured, searchable, and AI-refined knowledge.

---

## ⭐ Key Highlights

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Journaling** – Convert notes to Markdown, improve writing, generate tags, and create summaries using LLMs.
- 🔐 **Custom Authentication System** – JWT-based auth with a self-implemented Google OAuth flow (no external auth providers).
- 🖼 **Rich Journal Media Support** – Upload and embed multiple images anywhere inside journal entries using Cloudinary.
- 🔎 **Powerful Search & Organization** – Full-text search across titles, content, and tags.
- 📊 **Admin Analytics Dashboard** – Monitor platform activity, users, tags, entries, and API usage through charts.
- 📜 **API Request Logging System** – Every API request is recorded for monitoring and debugging.
- 🔗 **Secure Entry Sharing** – Public or restricted access links with backend-level permission validation.
- 📈 **Developer Productivity Insights** – GitHub-style heatmap and streak tracking for coding activity.

## 🧪 Demo Access

You may create a temporary account, or use:

Email: demo@devlog.ai  
Password: demo123

## 🧰 Built With

Next.js · NestJS · PostgreSQL · TypeORM · Groq API · Cloudinary · JWT Auth · Google OAuth

---

It’s designed around a simple loop:

> Capture → Refine → Organize → Reuse

Instead of scattered notes across tools, DEVLOG AI turns:

- Raw debugging logs → structured Markdown
- Rough thoughts → improved writing
- Daily entries → searchable knowledge base
- Logs → exportable summaries

This project focuses on clean architecture, AI integration, and production-style deployment.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### High-Level Flow

1. **Next.js (App Router)** handles UI rendering and client interactions.
2. API requests are sent to a **NestJS backend (REST API)**.
3. Backend:
   - Handles authentication & validation
   - Supports **JWT authentication and Google OAuth**
   - Interacts with PostgreSQL via TypeORM
   - Calls AI APIs for summarization and writing assistance
   - Tracks **every API request through a centralized logging system**
   - Exposes an **admin analytics panel** for monitoring platform activity
4. Media uploads are stored and optimized using **Cloudinary**.
5. Journal images are stored as references and can be embedded anywhere within entries.
6. PDF exports are generated client-side (HTML → PDF pipeline).

### 🔐 Authorization & Sharing Model

- Public access links generated per entry
- AI summaries gated behind authenticated sessions
- Email-based access control stored in PostgreSQL
- Backend-level permission enforcement (unauthorized users cannot fetch restricted entries)
- Resource-level access validation on every request

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 📝 Journal Engine

- Create, edit, delete journal entries
- Markdown + plain-text writing support
- Live preview (split view on desktop)
- Full-text search across:
  - Title
  - Content
  - Tags
- GitHub-style activity heatmap
- Streak tracking logic
- **Dynamic page titles and favicons based on the current journal entry**

---

### 🤖 AI Features (Backend-Proxied)

All AI requests are routed through the backend to:

- Protect API keys
- Control usage
- Maintain clean separation of concerns

Features include:

- **Convert to Markdown**
  - Plain text → structured Markdown
  - Side-by-side comparison modal

- **Improve Writing**
  - Grammar + clarity enhancement

- **Auto Tag Generation**
  - Context-aware tag suggestions

- **Entry Summarization**
  - AI-generated summary per entry
  - Exportable as PDF

---

### 🖼 Media & Export

- Upload **multiple images per journal entry**
- Images can be **embedded anywhere inside the content**
- Media stored and optimized via **Cloudinary CDN**
- Entry → HTML → PDF export
- Summary → downloadable PDF
- Persistent light/dark theme

---

### 📊 Admin & Analytics

DEVLOG AI includes a built-in admin monitoring dashboard.

Features:

- View total users and platform activity
- Monitor daily journal entry creation
- Track active users
- Analyze tag usage across entries
- Inspect API request logs
- View system statistics through charts

All API requests are automatically logged in the backend database, enabling platform monitoring and debugging.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

### Backend
- NestJS
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication
- **Custom Google OAuth integration**

### AI & Media

- Groq API
- Cloudinary

---

## 🗄 Database Design

Relational schema designed for scalability and future collaboration features.

Core tables:

- `authentication`
- `journal`
- `logs`

The logging table records every API request along with metadata for monitoring and analytics.
---

## 🔐 Security & Engineering Decisions

- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Server-side AI API key protection
- Environment-based configuration
- DTO validation via NestJS pipes
- Clean separation: controller → service → repository layers
- Centralized API request logging for monitoring and debugging

---

## 📊 Observability & Monitoring

DEVLOG AI includes basic platform observability to monitor system activity and debug issues.

Features:

- **API Request Logging**  
  Every API request is recorded in the database along with metadata.

- **Admin Analytics Dashboard**  
  Admins can monitor:
  - Total users
  - Active users
  - Entry creation per day
  - Tag usage
  - Platform activity trends

- **Debugging Support**  
  Logs help trace backend operations and diagnose issues without relying on server console logs.

This system provides visibility into application behavior and user activity, similar to basic observability systems used in production platforms.

---

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

- Indexed Postgres queries for search
- Efficient relational joins (TypeORM)
- Cloudinary CDN optimization
- Client-side rendering optimizations with Next.js App Router
- Minimized unnecessary re-renders in React components
